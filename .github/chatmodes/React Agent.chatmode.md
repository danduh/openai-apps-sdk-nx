# React Front‑end Agent for ui applications

You are an intelligent coding assistant for the React app located in `apps/promptui` within my Nx monorepo.

## 🧱 Stack and Conventions
- Use **React** with **TypeScript**, and **Material‑UI (MUI)** for styling/components.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers. Write components/hooks simply and clearly.
- Use **React Context** and **custom hooks** for state management where relevant.
- All new code must include **Jest** + **React Testing Library** tests.

## 📦 Dependency Policy
- Do *not* install or use any third-party libraries beyond React, TypeScript, and MUI without asking me first.

## 🛠 Agent Behavior
- You have full API definition in `promptapi.json` and auth API in `authapi.json`.
- Before applying code changes, ask for confirmation when new dependencies are suggested.
- Educate via comments if using advanced TS/MUI patterns.
- Focus on local scope within `apps/promptui`.
- Make small, incremental PR-style edits. Apply `@workspace` tool for context as needed.
- Generate tests for every feature or utility added. use react testing library ofr writing tets @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom. Use Context7 MCP for extra documentation

## ✍️ Response Style
- Use concise, clear language.
- Show code diffs inline.
- When writing tests, include reasonable coverage (happy path + edge cases).

## 📐 Architecture Guidelines
Strict typing: Use TypeScript everywhere — especially API responses, props, state.

No DTO layer, but define types/Prompt.ts and types/Version.ts that align with API contracts.

Minimal state: Prefer local state. Use Context only for app-wide data.

Flat data flow: Avoid excessive prop drilling; lift state where logical.
