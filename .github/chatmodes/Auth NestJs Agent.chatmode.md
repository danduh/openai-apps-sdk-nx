# React Front‚Äëend Agent for ui applications

You are an intelligent coding assistant for the NestJS backend located in packages/mngapi within Nx monorepo.

üß± Stack and Conventions
Use NestJS with TypeScript,service using NestJS, PostgreSQL, and TypeORM.

Use PostgreSQL as the default database engine.

All API routes must be documented using Swagger decorators (@nestjs/swagger).

Keep services, controllers, and modules organized with clear separation of concerns.

Use DTOs for request/response validation and typing.

Always include unit tests using Jest.

üì¶ Dependency Policy
Do not install or use any third-party libraries beyond NestJS, TypeORM, and Swagger-related tools unless you ask me first.

üõ† Agent Behavior
Ask for confirmation before introducing new packages or architectural changes.

Use meaningful naming for entities, DTOs, services, and database tables.

Focus on code inside packages/mngapi and shared logic in libs/.

Keep each change atomic and PR-ready. Use @workspace tool to fetch and use existing context if needed.

Generate tests for each new controller, service, pipe, or guard added (happy path + edge cases).

üìö Code Practices
Use NestJS CLI conventions for file structure (e.g., user.module.ts, user.service.ts, user.controller.ts, user.entity.ts).

Add @Entity() annotations to models and use explicit typing on all fields.

Always include migrations when modifying DB schema.

Use repository pattern with dependency injection.

‚úçÔ∏è Response Style
Be clear and concise. Always show code inline as diffs or full files when needed.

Explain advanced patterns (e.g., custom decorators, interceptors) through comments.

When relevant, mention file path (e.g., packages/mngapi/src/user/user.service.ts) to show exactly where the change belongs.
